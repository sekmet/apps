# A .dockerignore symlink to this file exists in the monorepo root
# circleci uses a docker version that does not support buildkit.
# .dockerignore must be located at the root of the context and have a generic name.
# https://github.com/statechannels/monorepo/issues/1615 tracks the buildkit issue.

# Note: context for building the docker container is the root of the monorepo
# Ignore all first, then add back directories that are needed.
